Data

This code book summarizes the resulting data fields in the tidy_data.txt data fie; a text file, containing space-separated values.

The first row contains the names of the variables, which are listed and described in the Variables section, and the following rows contain the values of these variables.

Average of measurements

All measurements are floating-point values, normalised and bounded within [-1,1].

Prior to normalisation, acceleration measurements (variables containing Accelerometer) were made in g's (9.81 m.s⁻²) and gyroscope measurements (variables containing Gyroscope) were made in radians per second (rad.s⁻¹).

Magnitudes of three-dimensional signals (variables containing Magnitude) were calculated using the Euclidean norm.

The measurements are classified in two domains:

Time-domain signals (variables prefixed by timeDomain) & frequency-domain signals

Variables
subject: The ID of the test subject - 1 to 30 (integer).

activity: Activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken - 6 possible values (string):

WALKING: subject was walking
WALKING_UPSTAIRS: subject was walking upstairs
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS: subject was walking downstairs
SITTING: subject was sitting
STANDING: subject was standing
LAYING: subject was laying

Transformations

The zip file located: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

The following transformations were made:

The training and test sets were merged to create one data set.
The measurements on the mean and standard deviation were extracted for each measurement.
The activity identifiers (originally coded as integers between 1 and 6) were replaced with descriptive activity names (see Identifiers section).
The variable names were replaced with descriptive variable names (e.g. tBodyAcc-mean()-X was expanded to timeDomainBodyAccelerometerMeanX), using the following set of rules:
Special characters (, /), and -) were removed
The initial f and t were expanded to frequency and time respectively.
Acc, Gyro, Mag, Freq, mean, and std were replaced with Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnitude, Frequency, Mean, and StandardDeviation respectively.
Replaced (supposedly incorrect as per source's features_info.txt file) BodyBody with Body.
From the data set in step 4, the final data set was created with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
The collection of the source data and the transformations listed above were implemented by the run_analysis.R R script (see README.md file for usage instructions).
